# Depression Detection from Facial Image using Deep Neural Network

This repository contains a source code/ trained model for depression classification. Source code can be adjust to be used with both Window/Mac machines, and also there is a jupyter notebook file that is able to run in Google Colab.

## Description

This project investigates the performance of predicting depression in a CNN and LSTM model using a single feature compared to a Multimodal model that combines multiple features to produce a prediction. The Distress Analysis Interview Corpus (DAIC), provided by the University of Southern California, was used to train all the models.
